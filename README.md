# Sedat Ceyhan / CS98 - Hack_a_thing_2

## Short description of what I attempted to build

* For the first hack-a-thing, I worked on web development as I did not take CS52 and didn't have enough experience in that area. I wasn't expecting to work on AR/VR game development with Unity for this class, so it wasn't my area of focus for the first hack-a-thing.
* As we want to build AR/VR game with Unity, that's what I've worked on for this hack-a thing. It was quite fun. My goal was to get familiar with the Unity platfrom and C#, and eventually deploy the game I build to my Android (Developing a simple AR/VR application via Unity and deploying that to my mobile phone)
* One part of this hack-a-thing was to see how we can deploy Unity games to mobile platform and whether it's hard to deploy the same game to both IOS and Android platforms. I have an Android, so I've developed this application for my Android, but I learned that it's just as simple to deploy the same game to IOS platform without making dramatic changes.
* The application I've build is basically a 3D drawing application to familiarize myself with the AR/VR.
* You run the application on your phone and you basically have a camera in front of you. Then, you draw something on the camera using your finger (e.g., a circle). That object becomes a 3D object standing exactly where you drew that object. You rotate around it and the object behaves like a real life object and you see it in different and logical perspectives. 

## Who did what

* I've worked alone on this, but my team and I decided to work on the Unity app deployment and I was the one responsible for exploring further about this particular task.

## What you learned

* I familiarized myself with Unity and C#, and learned how to deploy simple AR/VR apps to mobile platform.

## How does this hack-a-thing inspire you or relate to your possible project ideas?

* AR/VR area is quite huge and we have a lot of ideas and things that we want to do, but we need to be practical and efficient, so we are more inclined to work on mobile platform as well. Working on a Unity application and its deployement to mobile platform were 2 important tasks that we had to explore further

## What didn't work

* TESTING MY WORK! Testing the modifications and updates were much harder than I thought. I couldn't really use Unity platform for testing. AR application in general and in particuaar mine required the use of camera and thus the Unity platform didn't really reflect my work. When I add something and want to test it, I build and run the app, however, it doesn't represent the real work I want to see on my Android!
* The scary thing is that I followed a tutorial on this project and already knew how to approach this application and it was still hard to do the testing. Imagine how much harder it will be when we work on our own project!

## tutorial used

* This was the tutorial I followed for this hack-a-thing-2. It was a really really helpful tutorial that helped me learn lots of things.
